# SQL-Queries-for-Sorting-and-Grouping-Data

This repository contains a set of SQL queries designed to demonstrate data manipulation, sorting, grouping, and analysis using two relational tables: Country and Persons. The provided scripts showcase a variety of tasks including aggregation, filtering, random selection, and ordering.

## Project Overview

The project includes the following two tables:

*Country Table

Fields: Id, Country_name, Population, Area

Contains information about different countries, their populations, and land areas.

*Persons Table

Fields: Id, Fname, Lname, Population, Rating, Country_Id, Country_name

Represents individuals, including their names, associated populations, ratings, and references to the Country table.

# Table Creation

-- Queries

-- 1. Write an SQL query to print the first three characters of Country_name from the Country table. 

SELECT LEFT(COUNTRY_NAME,3) AS FIRST_3_CHARACTERS_OF_COUNTRIES FROM COUNTRY;

-- 2. Write an SQL query to concatenate first name and last name from Persons table.

SELECT CONCAT(F_NAME," ",L_NAME) AS FULLNAME FROM PERSONS;

-- 3. Write an SQL query to count the number of unique country names from Persons table.

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT COUNTRY_NAME) AS UNIQUE_COUNTRYNAME_COUNT FROM PERSONS;

-- 4. Write a query to print the maximum population from the Country table.

SELECT MAX(POPULATION) AS MAXIMUM_POPULATION FROM COUNTRY;

-- 5. Write a query to print the minimum population from Persons table

SELECT MIN(POPULATION) AS MINIMUM_POPULATION FROM PERSONS;

-- Insert 2 new rows to the Persons table making the Lname NULL. Then write another query to count Lname from Persons table. 

INSERT INTO PERSONS 
VALUES(11,'Dia',null,4000,3.5,2,'INDIA'),
(12,'Arhan',null,3500,3.2,3,'SRILANKA');
SELECT*FROM PERSONS;
SELECT COUNT(L_NAME) AS LASTNAME_COUNT FROM PERSONS;

-- 7. Write a query to find the number of rows in the Persons table.

SELECT COUNT(*) AS ROWS_COUNT FROM PERSONS;

-- 8. Write an SQL query to show the population of the Country table for the first 3 rows. (Hint: Use LIMIT)

SELECT POPULATION AS FIRST3COUNTRIES_POPULATION FROM COUNTRY LIMIT 3;

-- 9. Write a query to print 3 random rows of countries. (Hint: Use rand() function and LIMIT)

SELECT * FROM COUNTRY ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT 3;

-- 10. List all persons ordered by their rating in descending order. 

SELECT * FROM PERSONS ORDER BY(RATING) DESC;

-- 11. Find the total population for each country in the Persons table.

SELECT COUNTRY_NAME,SUM(POPULATION) AS TOTAL_POPULATION FROM PERSONS GROUP BY COUNTRY_NAME;

-- 12. Find countries in the Persons table with a total population greater than 50,000

INSERT INTO PERSONS 
VALUES(13,'ANGELENE','LAS',60000,3.5,2,'BRAZIL'),
(14,'ZERENE','HEGDE',55000,3.2,3,'SRILANKA');
SELECT COUNTRY_NAME,SUM(POPULATION)  AS TOTAL_POPULATION FROM PERSONS GROUP BY COUNTRY_NAME HAVING SUM(POPULATION)>50000;

-- 13. List the total number of persons and average rating for each country, but only for countries with more than 2 persons, 
--    ordered by the average rating in ascending order.

INSERT INTO PERSONS 
VALUES(15,'LOIUS','DON',56000,3.5,2,'USA'),
